        Because music will be exchanged between Choke and the public at a consistent rate, the contents of its catalogue is likely to change significantly in relatively short
        time spans. Thus, an active record of what's available can be found <a class="link" href="qa-externals/genre-external.html">here</a>. Use it for reference when placing 
        an order.

      <h5>Not profit-seeking but charge $20?</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
